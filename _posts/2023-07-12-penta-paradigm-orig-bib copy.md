Throughout the 7 decades of the pursuit of artificial intelligence, this field has mainly dealt with the fundamental issue of knowledge representation and processing. Here are some modelling paradigms of AI:


# Symbolic reasoning

- Symbols canâ€™t be differentiated
- What are symbols? Consider them logic predicates and ground atoms
- It takes a non-functional approach to modelling; a simple set of rules can lead to rich and diverse output (consider rules of grammar of certain language); 


# Probabilistic function approximation 

- Find a set of features that can map inputs to a set of outputs
- This mapping is always done from infinite domain to finite or infinite range, but never from finite domain to infinite range

# Reward reinforcement 

- Another non-functional approach aimed at designing an environment and an agent to maximize a reward signal within it. 

# Causal graphs

- Functional approach to modelling, but given the way in which information is stored, it allows causal interpretation of information beyond correlation. 

# Meta

- Modelling about modelling 
- Meta learning, which involves automatically fine-tuning parameters
- meta-heuristics

# Mergers

The above models can be assembled together to expand the capabilities of each, hopefully without compromising each other's strenghts while mitigating their respective weaknesses:

- Knowledge graph embeddings
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Heuristic-driven machine learning methods
- Neuro-symbolic AI
