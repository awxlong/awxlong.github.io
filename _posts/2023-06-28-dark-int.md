_Dark, Beyond Deep: A Paradigm Shift to Cognitive AI with Humanlike Common Sense_ is a paper by [Zhu, et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09044) I discussed in Dr. Antonio Vergari's weekly lab meeting. 

My slides are [here](https://awxlong.github.io/assets/pdf/deep-dark.pdf).

You can try the [Heider-Simmel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx7lBzHH7c8) experiment yourself. 

Here is a live [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmFK52WwSQg) of the Spatio-Temporal Causal And-Or Graph (STC-AoG) in action.
