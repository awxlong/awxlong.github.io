Hey, I need your opinion on this. Continuing our discussion on scaffolding before, I wanted to ask you about the following questions: how can a model represent the world? Symbolists argue using discrete symbols, while connectionist argue for distributed representation (an average of all training examples). Generative modelling is about finding latents that generate the world.  but all these models are pursuing an internal representation of the world. 

what if we step back and say, we don't need a representation. Instead, the world is the representation itself, and we need tools to parse or extract those representations. What do you think?


[15:03, 07/10/2023] awxuelong: so instead of having an internal representation of a clock, we instead have this and-or graph that can parse anything (including clocks). the result of the parse graph is our representation of it. 

in other words, we don't have an internal representation for every object, we have an universal parsing mechanism that can parse objects, resulting in representations that we denote as internal representations

to give an example, remember Song Zhu Chun's and-or graphs. we used it to parse bottles when we were talking that afternoon:
