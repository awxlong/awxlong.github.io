> [J]ust as mathematics turned out to be the right description language for physics, AI may turn out to play a similar role for biology - Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind

Test set is a pseudo-replication of the training set.

Cite Guy's paper on the paradox to learn to reason, and ObjectNet, and Stammer et al. ARC is also a dataset that makes sure the test set differes from the training set.  

We have no control on what artifacts of the dataset a deep learning model is looking at. If you only want to get the job done, such as car plate recognition for a reserved parking spot, or sentimen analysis on restaurant reviews, it'd suffice to either output feature maps

Prof. Xavier Trepat offers a very good [account](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07246-8) on the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up processes. Top-down allows us to explain traffic jams, while bottom-up processes at most help us know how cars work.   

In biomedicine, however, if we want to validate scientific discovery, mechanistic insight is imprescindible. In that regard, AI can't further scientific discovery, only aid. 

It is still the human scientists deciding what sequence of genes to decode. 

At least in coursework, More challenging benchmarks, then should involve modifications of the testing distribution in order to not mislead the audience that a DNN is performing greatly. 

In the future, however, I have confidence that AI can inspire future directions of research.
