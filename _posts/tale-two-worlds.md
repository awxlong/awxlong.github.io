There seems to exist two worlds which exist in the universe.

The real, natural world which can be accessible through empirical means, and the abstract, mathematical world which are the means themselves with which we observe the real, natural world.

We can't give shape to the mathematical world. It doesn't "exist" in the real world. Circles, polygons, numbers, operations, vectors, matrices, infinity, among others, all reside within our mind. A friend once pointed out that he can draw a line on a dining table[^1] with a marker, and that's a geometrical line. I disputed: "that is ink placed on a surface, which in your head is representing a geometrical line. While the ink and wooden surface are tangible objects, the geometrical line isn't. Miraculously, however, I can also see and understand what you're thinking concerning geometrical lines, suggesting the universality of math in the minds of _Homo sapiens_". (I may have edited my response to sound wiser, as well as edited the whole story to make it more entertaining).  

That math doesn't exist in the real world, and thus can't be picked up with our perceptual systems can explain why large vision models like DALL-E or MidJourney struggle with generating images which contain letters or numbers, unless they are fed with prior knowledge on [characters](https://research.google/pubs/pub52496/). This is partly because the vast amount of data in which they're trained mainly correspond to images taken from the natural, tangible, external world, e.g., photos under different styles of animals, buildings, groups of people, or landscapes.
