There seems to exist two worlds which exist in the universe.

The real, natural world which can be accessible through empirical means, and the abstract, mathematical world which are the means themselves with which we observe the real, natural world. 


Implications

We can't give shape to the mathematical world. It doesn't "exist" in the real world. Circles, polygons, numbers, operations, vectors, matrices, infinity, among others, all reside within our mind. A friend once pointed out that he can draw a line on a dining table[^1] with a marker, and that's a geometrical line. 

That math doesn't exist in the real world, and thus can't be picked up with our perceptual systems can explain why large vision models like DALL-E or MidJourney struggle with generating images which contain letters or numbers, unless they are fed with prior knowledge on [characters](https://research.google/pubs/pub52496/).
