_Walking down the paved road, on a rainy day, the individual gazes upon the plethora of infrastructure and humans giving off the scent of the modern era. An infinite amount of data is displayed on that high scraper, on the posters pasted on the translucent glass of that grocery shop shout out inspirational slogans from unknown people; on the walls, full of persuading words, of an enormous bus that invites the individual to travel with it, all of this while another infinite amount of data replace the aforementioned. This sea of information barges into the mind of the individual, and amidst this tempest, can the person still retain what is innate to them, or replace everything with anything being presented? The individual keeps walking straight, looking for an answer, until arriving inside that destined chamber. The atmosphere is denser, perhaps due to the raindrops encircling this room...it seems the windows are not translucent due to water being condensed, not allowing the individual to look clearly who is sitting beside that window..._

Reader: The 21st century lifted its curtains presenting to the plethora of societies the concept of globalization, which allowed each individual constituent of it to be connected to a dynamic and constantly growing learning community. Amidst this space that knows no frontiers, it's easy to be overawed by everything that's being presented. Nowadays, it's not difficult to know about the current trending phenomenon like "planking" and how it's followed by prestigious group, called "the Cool Kids"; about how certain author Shirley's literary work has caused unprecedented sensation in country Atlantis; it's possible to know that scientist Octopie, after years of effort and research, has achieved an unparalleled scientific discovery about cells or computers, it's simple to witness how that young athlete, despite just a teenager, has obtained gold medal in the Most Important International Competition of Importance; it's a source of jealousy the kind of life led by certain flashy celebrity; it's impressing to be notified that some entrepreneur, CEO of the multinational company of cells and cellphones, was the one in the vanguard for the economic prosperity of Atlantis. Before the individual realized, these achievements were nearer than they thought.  
In front of all these showy and blinding facts, one can be induced to ask: is it possible to imitate such dazzling achievements? Is it possible to copy all their sacrifices and reach the same glorious cusp they reached? Is it possible to merge into this reputable social sphere? From it, the fear of being unable to catch up to them emerges, as well as disappointment of how average one is, of how normal is one's life in comparison to others, of how little impact one can cause, stems. 

Author: if the world was a stage for a never-ending drama, then each one has the opportunity to be a leading actor on it. From this premise, indeed, the performance of certain people tends to receive more attention, hence appreciation, than others, nonetheless, establishing a comparison between different actors shouldn't lead to the undermining of one's own act, it shouldn't induce a detrimental sentiment of losing to others, losing to oneself and losing oneself. The previous effect might be the result of the inherent defects of designing a flawed system of comparison and still dishonestly present it to the individual without acknowledging its problems. Indeed, it's very common to witness how different entities like to agglutinate diverse people, homogenize their talents, contexts, experiences, nature and personalities under the same parameter in order to distinguish one from such group, dominating it as "the best of A", "the best at doing B", "the best in having C", among others (please fill in the variables with whatever you like). It's relatively arrogant to declare individual A is better than B at something, simply because both are fundamentally different; something about life will be very twisted if individuals (everything that represents one person) can be easily sorted out and categorized. 

For simplicity, imagine the following scenarios in which instead of individuals, groups of prople are being studied in order to convey the problems with systems of classification (indeed, large, voluptuous entities are easier to analyze than single individuals, analogous to how biologists find easier to study the behavior of biofilms than individual bacteria)[^1]. Imagine that there is a national survey to identify the most important contributors to the economic prosperity of a country; enterprises will head that list and the homogenizer parameters might be the quantity of workers (which in turn represents the quantity of families economically sustained), average salary, amount of budget for future investments, amount of affiliated companies, among others. Nonetheless, the uncertainty emerges by obviating relevant variables about the companies being hierarchized: what if rate of growth was an important factor for judging an enterprise, which means, while the company in first place required fifty years of development to reach that position, the one in fifth place just used fifteen years? What about enterprises which majority of workers just coincidentally prioritize savings over spending, hence do not contribute to economic flux? What about organizations that influence economic prosperity indirectly? (They constitute the main pillars sustaining a society by engaging in the process of the democratization of healthcare, in the yielding of scientific journals that push forward innovation and scientific progress, or in the massive spreading of high-quality education, thus not providing a direct economic benefit, but certainly building the future of a country). What is to extrapolate in this situation is that each entity has its own defining features which make the process of comparing them difficult and meaningless. The following is another scenario: an educational entity decides that a competition ought to be organized to produce the best short-film in the genre of horror, and in the end group B defeats group A. They are decorated with the title of "The Best Editors of the University", and the judges' justification is that based on the five criterions (space and time management, creativity, entertainment, complementarity of special effects and impact on the spectator). From that premise, a vast amount of problematic ramifications stems: what if group B had a larger budget and support given that one of its member's relative just happens to be a film director?, what would have changed if group A filmed the video conveying a profound & meaningful life message that wasn't noticed by the judges during the preliminary assessment? But, of course, if group A won in turn, what if group B was the one who dedicated the most time towards the crafting of the short-film, while group A just simply adapted a scene from a movie from last century?, what if all the members of group B truly desired to become film directors or actors in their respective futures, while group A participated simply to skip lectures and treats filming as a hobby, or vice versa? What if the organizer of the competition becomes arrogant and neglected the possibility of students with hidden talents who simply didn't participate because fatigue kicked in? 
In other words, it's worth noting that each group has unique circumstances because each member has their distinct backgrounds and experiences', hence trying to determine the "best out of these two" is controversial, since it'd be equivalent to ignoring these fundamental variables. 

The above are simply examples of what one can observe day by day in the hurricane of information that thrashes itself in front of the individual without one knowing about it, characterized by waves of comparative studies and hierarchical classifications that discriminate differences among those analyzed.

If the attention is focused on the individual, the situation doesn't change: each person has his or her own circumstances that distinguish that person from any other, and if a comparison is naively made, then essential qualities that make up the members of that system of classification will be ignored ... each individual is a sutra difficult to decipher thoroughly.

The hypothetical example (because it's easier to appeal to fictitious situations where humans aren't part of it given that it shouldn't be easy to construct a person with a distinctive behavior, personality and actions in an example) which helps illustrates the aforementioned involves visualizing a jungle in which distinct species are gathered together: monkey the mammal, a fish, a bird, a snake the reptile, and a frog the amphibious. A competition to establish the "best" of the group will be decided through a unified race that'll be run on top of a terrain (from this many distinctive characteristics of the animals are being ignored). Certainly, confronted by such an arbitrarily set competition, those who can't set foot on the soil might indeed feel disappointed by its own incapability and fall in a detrimental abyss. The fish can't run, but it can swim; the bird neither, but it can fly; the snake knows how to slide, the frog, jump and the monkey, swing... Would it be feasible for all of them to temporarily forget their own capabilities and attempt to run the race?
They can, indeed, and a winner will emerge (say, the bird) and subsequently be extolled as the "best" in the jungle. Though, of course, in these cases, comparing individuals who are fundamentally different might just be solely with purposes of entertainment and distractions. 
If this situation is adapted to real life, a message can be extrapolated: one will never reach that rival who surpasses one, for the simple reason that both just don't run the same kind of race. 

Reader: if between entity and entity, individual and individual, there exists such fundamental contrasting experiences and capabilities given that each carries with it an amalgam of diverse variables difficult to sort out or even comprehend thoroughly, to the point that it'd disrespectful to ignore them and compare these entities, then, from where do systems of classification derive their legitimacy? What is its utility? Why do humans position themselves next to others?

Author: as pronounced before, comparing perhaps is not bad, despite carrying fundamental flaws, but it's severely misinterpreted by the individual when one assumes that it ultimately leads to the undermining of oneself in front of someone "better". In that regard, one shouldn't be traumatized, or suffer, by being subject of comparison. 

These systems of classification do share their very valuable reasons to exist, hence requires the individual to take advantage of. In other words, although figuring out the inherent issues with system of classification, there is no need to change them fundamentally, only the way to view them. 

When hierarchies and comparison are made, whether as a result of a mental imprint stemmed from worries or jealousy, or shown to one by a foreign agent, it's easy to forget that the highlighting of certain people has the purpose of inspiring. Indeed, distinction should be one driving motor for progress in others. The achievements, as well as the incomprehensible effort attached, of an individual might be dazzling, and the light emanated is supposed to be guiding, not blinding in these hierarchies. Indeed, an individual might contemplate the brightness of those achievements, but this should be on the basis of one not forgetting who one is, what is his story, his ideals, personality, experience and realize that these variables dictate the inability to run the same race as the one he contemplates, let alone acquire his prize. Honorable individuals should be referents whose unforgettable achievements inspire the person, whose sacrifices are understood so to grasp how success is built, so that ultimately one adapts them based on what one aspires to become[^2]. If there is any meaning behind the jungle's race, then it's worth asking what can the monkey learn from the movements of the frog, the altitude of the bird's flying so to know about winds' currents, the fish's swimming and its adaptability to the environment, and the snake sliding, so that it can enhance furthermore its ability to swing between trees. Indeed, if the monkey doesn't compare, from where can it base its actions on? Without having something to base its actions from, how can it better itself?
Hierarchies, in that regard, were meant to be climbed (through one's own capabilities) instead of being an archetypical map where every member of it should accept and extoll. When one tries to mold one's future and acts on behalf of it, competing with others might to some extent allow the individual to know oneself better (flaws, strengths, likes, dislikes), so that ultimately one can enhance one's own performance, own way of acting in that stage. A hierarchy should be built on the basis of respect through acknowledging the fundamental differences between human beings. From that premise, hierarchies, neither, were static structures where individuals are added and each one can only accept the position assigned, but rather a dynamic mosaic model in which everyone climbs through achievements, falls through failures and climbs up again as the result of not wanting to give up what has been achieved before, and falls again... There exists not the best, then, but only better. For that matter, when being exposed to the infinite amount of data displayed around one's community, one must discern a very ugly, yet beautifully crafted lie, which is that there doesn't exist the "best" product (where is the room for innovation, then?), "best" trademark (where is the room for competence?), "best" institution (can a numerical position represent its history, reputation, extent to which individuals contributed society, performance of future members?), "best" book (where is the respect for knowledge being borderless and diverse?), but instead acknowledge that comparisons should be made dynamic, whilst keeping in mind that differences among individuals shouldn't be ignored, but rather honestly acknowledged and taken into account when analyzing them. 
Perfection, if allowed to be redefined, then, is not seeking the illusion of completeness, but rather a measure of the extent to which one humbly aspires to become better. Pausing at one train station, and being dishonest by declaring that one can't get further, is therefore misleading.
The rain stopped a while ago, and though the windows are still condensed, when the individual actually focuses on looking, a clearer view is being projected of who is sitting beside it, in front of that desk with the settler of that chamber. 
Reader: no matter what the monkey learns from its brethren, it will never be able to fly. Swing as high as it can, or low as it desires, can it touch the sky like the bird, or dive deep into the ocean as the fish? For that matter, what if the other animals of the jungle just generally admire the clear, blue sky more than the plain, flat terrain, hence attribute more value to the actions of that bird, who can explore myriads of kilometers away, and return whenever it desires, who has a wider space to express itself? If we return to what was said in the beginning, the world is indeed a stage, acts being always changed, and therefore the themes of those acts changes. What if the audience show bias towards certain themes, wouldn't that undermine one's act? Comparing is indeed flawed, and indeed the system should be dynamic as everyone has room to grow, everyone fails and can climb up back again. But the room for growth is different, isn't it, can the room of growth for the monkey exceed that of the bird? 
Author: indeed, when addressing the human world, the current century has placed particular emphasis towards the natural and exact sciences[^3]. This in turn begets the question, what about the other fields? How can one shine as the bird when the context (something not within one's control) favors the bird? Historically, we humans behaved like this, as there were times when the primary focuses were philosophy, religion, anthropology, as each of them were the guiding fields of study that allowed us to seek what is reality, what constitutes as being, what is beyond our eyes, all in order to satiate curiosity, a driving force for life. When times changed, the center of attention switched to the arts, architecture, politics, as when humans became more systematically organized, the need to communicate feelings and ideas to one another, to build infrastructure so to be easily interconnected, to manage relations and dictate laws for a peaceful and efficient organization. The ruthless clock continued to tick, and the focus has been placed upon the sciences, as it drives innovation and further simplification for the world's way of living. Of course, no era "abandoned" previous fields of study.  
As such, cards and cards has been changed throughout history and the individual, perhaps regretting being born in the "wrong" era with a different focus, can indeed question, can the room of growth for the monkey exceed that of the bird, when the jungle's preference for terrestrial animals have expired long since trees have grown so tall that they overshadow the floor? Nonetheless, there is a fundamental flaw when asking this kind of self-undermining questions. 

Up until now, the discussion about hierarchies have been built upon externally, and it's structured with diverse people in it. However, it's worth mentioning that a very, if not the most, important hierarchy has been ignored, which is the one that's built within oneself. This internal hierarchy can be used to ask a rhetorical question in response to the previous interrogative: if the monkey knows it was born to swing among trees, and by watching the bird it learnt to swing higher than before, why would it desire to fly, an action that just doesn't belong to being a monkey? Why, though the sky can be extolled, is the earth not admired by the one who naturally inhabits it? 
For a person like Shirley, who was born with certain talent, say doing math-inspired art, then an external hierarchy is built so that Shirley can polish the skills granted at birth in doing art and be inspired to become better and different from others. The internal hierarchy is meant for Shirley to ask who she is: what are Shirley's ambitions, desires, circumstances, context? What can Shirley do so to reach a maximum potential out of? But this internal hierarchy's questions should be asked without unnecessary distractors such as those that can be extrapolated from external hierarchies: the sense of success, admiration to the victorious, recognition or acknowledgement, or even more material parameters such as those of fame, and/or monetary compensation, given that these can do more harm if they are not addressed properly by the individual. As said, in such a globalized world, with such a high degree of influx of information, one tends to ask who do I aspire to be or how can I acquire the skills of those I don't know, but usually forgets to reflect on who am I, or what constitutes that one person. 
In that regard, understanding the nature of this internal hierarchy is more fruitful and meaningful when thought about, as it allows tracing the individual's growth and honing the skills the individual was born with. Once again, it's also a dynamic model in which the individual can ask, instead of how can I become like that, how can I become more like myself? How have I grown into being myself compared to before? ... Amidst this tempest of data revolving around the individual, if one doesn't inquire who one is (one's own unique circumstances, desires, capabilities), hence doesn't cultivate them to their maximum potential, proudly acknowledges them or expresses/articulates them sporadically, then what's feared is that they might become lost within oneself, forgotten and replaced by the foreign inputs of society... To not fall into this bottomless abyss, one should climb one's respective external and internal hierarchies, and even if it results in being average, one shouldn't averagely give up when falls, shouldn't averagely feel victorious when succeeds... Conversely, of course, the individual can lie to the self and indeed follow the footsteps of those the individual admires, in the process casting away that debris lost within oneself. Perhaps on that path, the person can forget what once defined that individual, despite being bathed by the ecstasy of success or fame. It would only seem that nothing truly belonged to that person: the individual, because of hedonistic lies after lies, never had own dreams (as they were borrowed), own struggles (as they were others'), own victories (as they were copied). 
In that wild jungle, the monkey superficially cultivates its skills of swinging by watching the bird, learning from the fish, observing the snake, following the frog, but beyond that (or complementary to that) what else can the monkey do to showcase it's a unique monkey, special to others, special to oneself? For that matter, one is more than one thinks of oneself (as there is a plethora of questions to ask the self for the duration of one's life on how to fulfill the requirements of being oneself, and infinite struggles and victories to follow), just less than one exaggerates, as being a node of an interconnected world, the individual is not the only one asking and bettering oneself, but can rather take the opportunity to learn from one another, in the process realizing the fundamental differences that separates each one, extrapolating meaning in seeking to understand them. 

In the end, cultivate your own seeds, grow your own crops; borrow your neighbor's knowledge and experience, but together model your own gardens.
