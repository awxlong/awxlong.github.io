__Why Consilience?__

The __consilience__ of knowledge essentially means finding the principles which underlying two or more distinct branches of knowledge. People who subscribe to the idea that knowledge, in its many shapes and forms, is intimately connected, can be referred to as "consilientists". We are often in awe by questions such as "what's the fundamental question?" to ask in particularly field of knowledge such as math, or artificial intelligence. The unknowns behind such fundamental questions, along with their answers, would shed insight into how seemingly disparate fields like AI and, say, cuisine, are deep down interconnected. The intrisic value of asking fundamental questions, and gauging principles of knowledge rather than superficial forms of knowledge, is that while consilientists can't know everything, they can _know the things that help them understand most things_. 

In the book by Edward Wilson, he discussed the fundaments which tie the biological and the social sciences, of which can be succintly summarized as $phenotype = genotype + environment$. The beauty of such equation rests in the infinite amount of knowledge which hides behind such abstract simplicity. Phenotype is regarded as an abstract term with which we describe the human or humans' conditions, the subject of study of the social sciences. 


People like us who are interested in the consilience of knowledge are lateral thinkers, meaning that we like to focus on the “big picture”, as in how a piece of knowledge fits with other knowledge, instead of compromising oneself to this type of knowledge.  To achieve consilience, it is required to know something about everything, and find a common principle that could explain most things.  It is not being a polymath, i.e., knowing everything.  It is being open to several ideas, and that ideas that seemingly contradict each other, may actually complement once we think deeply enough about them. For example, the empiricist vs. nativist debate in cognitive science (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-cognition/) . To me, while empiricism and nativism are advertised as opposing ideas, in the eyes of a consilient researcher, they’re complementary. This is because empiricists

Additionally, problems are solutions (because we can only ask questions for which we can have the answer, or we ask the questions based on the answer I can obtain). Capitalism and communism are complementary. 
I’m often interested by questions such as:
-	Are two seemingly different ideas just two faces of the same coin? For example, in machine learning, one article that recently caught my interest is interpreting transformers as, essentially, support vector machines. Also, sum-product networks, Chew-Lieu trees, et al. are, in essence, probabilistic circuits. 
-	Are two ideas that are often pitted against each other complementary to each other, rather than contradictory? 
There are different ways to achieve consilience, despite the irony that consilience, by the definition is the search for an universal principle, or a theory of everything. Prof. Edward O. Wilson mainly advocates for common principles through an empiricist/reductionist, excluding approaches such as rationalism or deduction. In the literature, empiricists and rationalists are commonly pitted against each other, on the assumption that acceptance of empiricism negates rationalism. But as argued in point 2 above, to my opinion, they not only are not against each other, they complement each other. Empiricist can explain how our mind can learn from external data, but can’t explain how we reason about math, simply because math doesn’t exist in the real world. Nativists can answer how we reason about math by arguing it is endowed by our genes after some random mutation in that marked the beginning of the Homo sapiens species, but this doesn’t mean that they can reject the relevance of learning from environmental cues.




-	An interesting perk/personality quirk of people who are devoted to the consilience of knowledge is to also be worried about the future:
o	Pedro Domingos worried about the rise of autocratic systems
o	Prof. Noam Chomsky on the rise of imperialism: I think this is perhaps due to the worry that we have to set an equal footing ground for different people constrained by their genetic endowment. In the end, although we are in an inherently Darwinian society, our consciousness would forbid us to actually live in a society where biological constraints determine the rights of an individual. We are anarcho-syndicalists precisely because we can be, and are confident to go beyond our genetic endowment. 
o	
It is perhaps not the inherent intelligence in animals that’s objectively true, but rather our mysterious mental machinations that is leading us to perceive higher intelligence in other non-human animals. A dolphin or dog that can seemingly count, a bonobo that can solve puzzles, a herd of elephants that supposedly organize a funeral or squid that can squirt to anger human spectators is perhaps not evidence of cognition or consciousness in non-human animals, at least at the same degree of their human counterparts, but rather behavior that’s pre encoded in their genes. What is impressive, in my opinion, is our brains’ capability to craft stories, causal interpretations of these external events.

I propose 
I’m personally critical of reductionism or empiricism (for a better take please read David Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity). The problem with reductionism is its lack of explanatory power for meaningful phenomena like universal cultural values, history of the emergence of nation-states, or love. At its core, reductionism aims at proposing as a theory of everything the interplay of molecules and fundamental forces, which equifinal outcome make them meaningless to explain any phenomena. The problem with empiricism is that one often shapes hypothesis and instruments of measurement based on the evidence one wants to collect. We need creativity, and imagination in order to discover more knowledge, both truthful and meaningful, and in doing so helps to achieve the consilience of knowledge. 
phenotype = ( gene + environment ) * consciousness 

phenotype encapsulates the physical, behavioral and emotional trait of an individual organism. 
gene refers to the selfish gene, or mutations, that are inherited from progenitors. Genetics is also what predisposes us to fight against each other, and our consciousness can either amplify this predisposition for war or tone it down. 
environment refers to the geographical constraints in which an organism lives and influences how a gene expresses, and thus how an organism develops. 
Epigenetic rules or epigenesis is heredity and environmental factors 
I personally add consciousness as an additional component to epigenetic rules which influences our phenotype. I placed it in the right hand side of the equation, instead of the left hand side, on the assumption that it is not a physical property. This is debatable nonetheless. 
Consciousness refers to our mental capacity (call it intelligence if yoy u may) which can shake off the shackles of our genes and environment. Consciousness, or the capacity to stay conscious, is the central drive of humans to domesticate other species, nature itself and, through science and technology, pursue a meaningful life beyond what the selfish gene and environment dictate. Unlike animals, with a lower degree of consciousness (or hunekers as Douglas Hofstadter would call), then non-human animals are only able to act according to their epigenetic rules. 
Consciousness allowed us humans to alter drastically our environment, to the point of compromising our long-term survival. Soon, it would also allow us to modify our very that predisposes to a large extent our phenotype.  
wanted to share with you an equation that represents the principle of the human condition:

phenotype = (genotype + environment) * consciousness

it is basically saying that the human condition (the phenotype) is the result of the human's genome, environment in which he developed, everything moderated by consciousness. You may have seen the equation phenotype = genotype + environment. I added the * consciousness portion to illustrate the difference between us and the non-human animals. Namely, the condition of non-human animals, which may have a low-degree of consciousness, are mostly determined by their genes and environment. We, however, can influence both our genes and environment thanks to our consciousness
another thought experiment is that the consciousness variable could be universal, as in, consciousness is the same "principle" for all humans, but it is personalized because of each human's unique gene and environment.
